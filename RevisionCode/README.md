Phylogenetic comparative analyses of primate cerebellar and ansiform area volumes.

Based on comments in the Review process, we added the following groups of analysis:
1. Teasing apart strepsirrhine/haplorrhine scaling;
2. Teasing apart ape/non-ape scaling;
3. Assessing robustness to within- and across-brain variability (shrinkage and interspecific variability)
4. Assesing the role the museum collection in the data. Indirectly assess potentially inequel shrinkage as well.
5. A more conservative analysis that removes potential outliers identified from the literature.
6. Assessing the role of brain volume within our analyses.
7. Assessing the effect of sex and age, where possible.

All custom code used in this project can be accessed in this repository. We used R version 4.1.0 (2021-05-18) for all analyses. 
We also upload input files, and derivative tables that may be used for your own analyses.
Lastly, all outputs including (intermediate) figures, text files, and tables with full outcomes are uploaded. 
Final figures for publication were created in Inkscape.

First, place all input files in your home directory. Then, all scripts should work after simply changing the working directory to your own.


Scripts are relatively richly annotated, and should facilitate understanding of the meaning of each file in this folder.
For any questions about the code, or troubleshooting, you can contact the authors directly (see the publication at: doi...)

In this main folder you will find:
- Scripts (scr)
- Input: all input files (used and not used in the current project).
- Output: intermediate and final files for all analyses (foldered and number 1 through 7)
