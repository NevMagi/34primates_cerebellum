This folder contains a link to Colaboratory code that can be used to retrieve volumes from the BrainBox API.
It currently retrieves data from the layer that contains ansiform area segmentations from one observer, but the code can be changed to accomodate any BrainBox layer.
You need to be a member of the project first, however.
This is necessary to retrieve a randomly generated token that allows interaction with the API.
